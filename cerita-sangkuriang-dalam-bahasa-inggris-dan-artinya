                        Narrative Text<p><strong>JAWABAN:</strong></p><p>Dayang Sumbi was a beautiful and kind hearted princess. One day her weaving tool fell. Tumang, a male dog, came to bring her tool back to her. As she had promised, she married him. Tuman was actually a man who had been cursed by a witch to become a dog. But sometimes he could turn back to a normal man. Dayang Sumbi and Tumang got one son. His name was Sangkuriang. He did not know that Tumang was his father because he was a dog whenever he was with him. </p><p>One day Dayang Sumbi asked Sangkuriang to bring her deer's heart. But after many days in the woods, he could not find a deer. He did not want to disappoint his mother, so he killed Tumang and brought his heart home and gave it to his mother. Dayang Sumbi knew it. She got very angry at Sangkuriang. She hit him with a piece of wood on his forehead and told him to go away. </p><p>
One day Sangkuriang went back to his village. There he met a beautiful young woman. He fell in love with her at first sight. He did not know that she was Dayang Sumbi that could never get older.</p><p>
One day he proposed her. Dayang Sumbi saw the bad scar on his forehead. She soon realized that he was her own son. She told him the truth again and again but he would not believe her. She was thinking hard to find a way not to marry him. Then she got an idea. She asked him to make her a lake and a boat in one night.

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p><strong>The story of "Sangkuriang" The legend of Mount Tangkuban Parahu</strong></p><p></p><p>- it was told in ancient times that the king of the "princely breeding" came down from heaven and went hunting to earth. In the middle of the woods the king pours a urine that is contained in caring leaves. A female boar named wayungyang who wished to become human drank urine earlier. The way that got pregnant and gave birth to a pretty baby. The beautiful baby was taken to the keraton by her father and named dayang sumbi, A.K.A. rarasati. Many of the Kings wanted to take him in, but none were accepted, and finally the Kings went to war because of his desperate request to seek solitude upon a hill and accompanied by a dog named "the tumang." At the time of weaving, the loom loom loom was used. Lady sumbi, due to her lazy, thoughtless speech, promises that whoever takes the torak when it has a male gender, she will make him her husband. Unexpectedly it was the braids who took the torak and gave it to the dauphin, since this last word finally dayang sumbi married the girl and had a son and was named sangkuriang.</p><p></p><p>One day when the mule was hunting in the forest, he ordered that a boar be chased but the giant refused, since the boar was the wayungyang. In a moment of anger it was hurled at the lump and killed it and the liver of the braid was taken and given to dayang sumbi to cook. After the sumbi daemon learned that the liver that had been cooked was the liver of the stir-fried chicken, it was angry that the pupa daemon had been struck with a straw made from coconut husks and left a scar. And he got rid of that cage.</p><p></p><p>Sangkuriang goes wandering around the world. After a long eastward journey, it finally reached the west again and had unwittingly come back to the place of dayang sumbi, where her mother was. She did not know that the beautiful daughter she found was dayang sumbi (her mother). A love story developed between the two. One day when he slept on the sumbi's lap and accidentally saw a scar on his head and then said that it was his daughter. But still she insisted on marrying him. Since it's so stubborn that the crown prince can't refuse but on two conditions. The first that the government wants to build a huge boat and the second that has to be prepared, the requirements must be completed within the evening and that a delivery is made.</p><p></p><p>So a boat was constructed from a huge tree growing eastward, the stump of the tree turned into a mountain of dike hills. The twigs are dumped on the west and become a burangrang mountain. With the help of the gubercles (genres), the dam is almost finished. The empress was also very concerned and appealed to the gods to prevent her plot from being fulfilled. The sumbi woman spreads a wedge of boeh ranged (its white cloth) and the dawn is breaking on the eastern horizon.</p><p></p><p>He was furious, knowing that he could not complete the request of dayang sumbi. At the top of its ang, a dam at the sanghyang was pushed at the tikoro, a blockage of the citarum river was cast and turned into a mountain mang. Bandung waters subsided. The boat he worked on he hardly kicked him northward and transformed into a parahu mountain of tangkuban.</p><p></p><p>He chased after the sumbi daemon, who suddenly disappeared on the princess's mountain and turned into a single cherry blossom. As for spiders. After arriving in a place called the ujungberung, eventually the rider disappeared into the invisible realm called "the vulture."</p><p></p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p>MAAF BILA SALAH</p><p>SEMOGA BERMANFAAT ^^</p><p></p><br />

                        english:<br /><p>Once upon a time, a beautiful girl named Dayang Sumbi lived in the ancient and mystical lands of West Java. As she grew, many noblemen and princes fell in love with her, but she spurned their advances and instead spent her days weaving beautiful textiles.</p><p></p><p>While she sat in the garden terrace with her weaving one day, a tool dropped to the ground below, outside of the palace grounds. As daughter of the king, she was prohibited from leaving the palace on foot.</p><p>However, she promised that she would marry any man who could return the weaving tool, and soon Tumang the dog god came along and restored her precious equipment to her. This deity had committed a sin, for which the highest mother goddess incarnated him on earth as an animal.</p><p>Though her rescuer was a dog, Dayang Sumbi felt obliged to marry him anyway, and this caused a scandal in the palace. The princess was banished and found herself living in a small house in the woods.</p><p></p><p>It was while the couple was confined to their cottage that the princess discovered that Tumang transformed into a handsome god during the full moon. Eventually, Dayang Sumbi gave birth to a son, whom they name Sangkuriang.</p><p>Ten years later, Sangkuriang was old enough to be hunting for food to provide for his mother and his dog (who he did not realize was also his father). One day, his mother sent him out because she was craving deer liver. Sangkuriang took Tumang with him, and they chased a wild boar until Tumang–still in dog form–realized that the boar was the reincarnated deity who gave birth to Dayang Sumbi.</p><p>Tumang prevented Sangkuriang from killing his own grandmother, but the boy became frustrated and lashed out at the dog, accidentally killing him. Sangkuriang was devastated by Tumang’s death as well as the fact that he had not been able to obtain deer liver for his mother, so he cut out the dog’s liver and brought it home to his mother.</p><p>Dayang Sumbi unknowingly cooked the liver and only after eating her share did she tell her son to summon Tumang for his meal. Sangkuriang was overcome with shame and confessed to his mother, who became so outraged that she hit Tumang on the head and drove him out of the house.</p><p>As a result of the blow to his head, Sangkuriang slowly lost all memory of his mother and started a nomadic life in the woods. By the time Dayang Sumbi calmed down enough to search for the boy, he was long gone. She prayed to the gods that she would someday be reunited with her son, and she became vegetarian to atone for having eaten her lover.</p><p></p><p>More than a decade later, Sangkuriang was walking through the forest one day when he saw a beautiful woman standing outside a cottage, and the two fell in love with each other. Not once did the man recognize this cottage as the place where he was raised.</p><p>The day before the wedding, Dayang Sumbi realized that the man she was about to marry was her son. When she revealed the truth to Sangkuriang, he did not believe her and insisted on their marriage.</p><p>To deter Sangkuriang, Dayang Sumbi set her son a set of impossible tasks, refusing to marry him unless he accomplished them.</p>Sangkuriang must fill the entire valley with water.He must provide a boat so that they can sail across the newly-formed lake.These things must be completed in one night.<p></p><p>What Dayang Sumbi did not know was that Sangkuriang had acquired supernatural skills, and he called upon the spirits to help him create the lake. He cut down a large tree to make the boat, and he had almost finished building it as dawn approached.</p><p>Seeing that she had underestimated Sangkuriang, Dayang Sumbi remembered her old talent for weaving and quickly wove a magical scarf. The bright fabric filled the sky with golden light, and farmers and animals rose, mistaking the flashes of light for sunrise.</p><p>Sangkuriang thought that he had failed, and his anger caused him to violently kick his nearly-completed vessel. He transformed the overturned boat into Mount Tangkuban Perahu, a volcano that can still be seen today.</p><p></p><p>As for the doomed lovers, Dayang Sumbi pleaded with the gods to help her so that she could escape Sangkuriang’s wrath.</p><p>Sangkuriang went insane from spending so much time in the jungle searching for his lost love. Unbeknownst to him, the gods had answered Dayang Sumbi’s plea and transformed her into a flower.</p><p><br /></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Long time ago in West Java, lived a beautiful girl named Dayang Sumbi. She was also smart and clever. Her beauty and intelligence made a prince from the heavenly kingdom of Kahyangan desire her as his wife. The prince asked permission from his father to marry Dayang Sumbi. People from Kahyangan could never live side by side with humans, but his father approved on one condition, when they had a child, the prince would transform into a dog. The prince accepted the condition.</p><p>They get married and lived happily in the woods until Dayang Sumbi gave birth to a baby boy. The prince then changed into a dog named Tumang. Their son is named Sangkuriang. He was very smart and handsome like his father. Everyday, he hunted animals and looked for fruits to eat. One day, when he was hunting, Sangkuriang accidentally killed Tumang. His arrow missed the deer he was targeting and hit Tumang instead. He went home and tells her mother about the dog. “What?” Dayang Sumbi was appalled. Driven by sadness and anger, she grabbed a weaving tool and hit Sangkuriang’s head with it. Dayang Sumbi was so sad; she didn’t pay any attention to Sangkuriang and started to cry.</p><p>Sangkuriang feel sad and also confused. How can his mother love a dog more than him? Sangkuriang then decided to go away from their home and went on a journey. In the morning, Dayang Sumbi finally stopped crying. She started to feel better, so she went to find Sangkuriang. But her son was no where to be found. She looked everywhere but still couldn’t find him. Finally, she went home with nothing. She was exhausted. She fell asleep, and in her dream, she meets her husband. “Dayang Sumbi, don’t be sad. Go look for my body in the woods and get the heart. Soak it with water, and use the water to bathe, and you will look young forever,” said the prince in her dream. After bathing with the water used to soak the dog’s heart, Dayang Sumbi looked more beautiful and even younger.</p><p>And time passed by. Sangkuriang on his journey stopped at a village and met and fell in love with a beautiful girl.He didn’t realize that the village was his homeland and the beautiful girl was his own mother, Dayang Sumbi. Their love grew naturally and he asked the girl to marry him. One day, Sangkuriang was going on a hunt. He asked Dayang Sumbi to fix the turban on his head. Dayang Sumbi was startled when she saw a scar on his head at the same place where she, years ago, hit Sangkuriang on the head.</p><p>After the young man left, Dayang Sumbi prayed for guidance. After praying, she became convinced that the young man was indeed her missing son. She realized that she had to do something to prevent Sangkuriang from marrying her. But she did not wish to disappoint him by cancelling the wedding. So, although she agreed to marry Sangkuriang, she would do so only on the condition that he provides her with a lake and built a beautiful boat, all in one night.</p><p>Sangkuriang accepted this condition without a doubt. He had spent his youth studying magical arts. After the sun went down, Sangkuriang went to the hill. Then he called a group of genie to build a dam around Citarum River. Then, he commands the genies to cut down trees and build a boat. A few moments before dawn, Sangkuriang and his genie servants almost finished the boat.</p><p>Dayang Sumbi, who had been spying on him, realised that Sangkuriang would fulfill the condition she had set. Dayang Sumbi immediately woke all the women in the village and asked them to wave a long red scarf. All the women in the village were waving red scarf, making it look as if dawn was breaking. Deceived by false dawn, the cock crowed and farmers rose for the new day.</p><p>Sangkuriang’s genie servants immediately dropped their work and ran for cover from the sun, which they feared. Sangkuriang grew furious. With all his anger, he kicked the unfinished boat. The boat flew and landed on a valley. The boat then became a mountain, called Mount Tangkuban Perahu (Tangkuban means upturned or upside down, and Perahu means boat). With his power, he destroyed the dam. The water drained from the lake becoming a wide plain and nowadays became a city called Bandung (from the word Bendung, which means Dam).</p><br />

                        SANGKURIANG<br /><br />Once upon a time, a beautiful lady named Dayang Sumbi gave birth to a boy which she named Sangkuriang. When Sangkuriang was old enough to hunt, he took his mother’s dog Tumang (which according to this legend is an incarnation of a god and also Sangkuriang’s father) and ordered Tumang to chase after a boar. When Tumang did not follow Sangkuriang’s order, Sangkuriang became very angry and he killed Tumang. He carved out Tumang’s heart and brought it back to his mother. Dayang Sumbi took the heart, cooked it and ate it. When she discovered that the heart belonged to Tumang, her husband, she was overcome with wrath. She sent her son away, but not before she hit him with a spoon and left a deep scar on his head. Sangkuriang travelled around the world. After a long while, he arrived back in his village again without recognizing it. He saw a beautiful lady and fell in love with her. Little did he know that she was his own mother. He asked for her hand in marriage and she agreed. Dayang Sumbi later realized that Sangkuriang was her son, as she recognized the scar that she had inflicted. She tried to tell him and break off the wedding, but he didn’t believe her and insisted to go on with the wedding. Dayang Sumbi then set an impossible condition that Sangkuriang has to fulfill in order to marry her: he should build her a big boat and a lake by damming Citarum river, all within one night, and it shall be finished by dawn. Sangkuriang agreed to the condition. He built a boat from a large tree, and with the help of spirits, he dammed the Citarum river with landslides. The water eventually rose and filled the plain, turning it into a lake. When dawn was near, he was almost ready. Dayang Sumbi realized this, so she prayed for divine intervention. As an answer to her prayers, the eastern horizon lit up. Deceived by the lights, cocks crowed and farmers rose for the new day, thinking that dawn has broken<br />Sangkuriang was also deceived. He thought his endeavor has failed. Angrily, he kicked the boat so that it toppled over. This boat became Tangkuban Parahu mountain (tangkuban means upside down, and parahu means boat). The pile of leftover woods became Mt. Burangrang, and the rest of the big tree became Mt. Bukit Tunggul. The lake became lake Bandung  <br /><br /><br />#conquer or die<br />

                        Long time ago in West Java, lived a beautiful girl named Dayang Sumbi. She was also smart and clever. Her beauty and intelligence made a prince from the heavenly kingdom of Kahyangan desire her as his wife. The prince asked permission from his father to marry Dayang Sumbi. People from Kahyangan could never live side by side with humans, but his father approved on one condition, when they had a child, the prince would transform into a dog. The prince accepted the condition.<br /><br />They get married and lived happily in the woods until Dayang Sumbi gave birth to a baby boy. The prince then changed into a dog named Tumang. Their son is named Sangkuriang. He was very smart and handsome like his father. Everyday, he hunted animals and looked for fruits to eat. One day, when he was hunting, Sangkuriang accidentally killed Tumang. His arrow missed the deer he was targeting and hit Tumang instead. He went home and tells her mother about the dog. “What?” Dayang Sumbi was appalled. Driven by sadness and anger, she grabbed a weaving tool and hit Sangkuriang’s head with it. Dayang Sumbi was so sad; she didn’t pay any attention to Sangkuriang and started to cry.<br /><br />Sangkuriang feel sad and also confused. How can his mother love a dog more than him? Sangkuriang then decided to go away from their home and went on a journey. In the morning, Dayang Sumbi finally stopped crying. She started to feel better, so she went to find Sangkuriang. But her son was no where to be found. She looked everywhere but still couldn’t find him. Finally, she went home with nothing. She was exhausted. She fell asleep, and in her dream, she meets her husband. “Dayang Sumbi, don’t be sad. Go look for my body in the woods and get the heart. Soak it with water, and use the water to bathe, and you will look young forever,” said the prince in her dream. After bathing with the water used to soak the dog’s heart, Dayang Sumbi looked more beautiful and even younger.<br /><br />And time passed by. Sangkuriang on his journey stopped at a village and met and fell in love with a beautiful girl.He didn’t realize that the village was his homeland and the beautiful girl was his own mother, Dayang Sumbi. Their love grew naturally and he asked the girl to marry him. One day, Sangkuriang was going on a hunt. He asked Dayang Sumbi to fix the turban on his head. Dayang Sumbi was startled when she saw a scar on his head at the same place where she, years ago, hit Sangkuriang on the head.<br /><br />After the young man left, Dayang Sumbi prayed for guidance. After praying, she became convinced that the young man was indeed her missing son. She realized that she had to do something to prevent Sangkuriang from marrying her. But she did not wish to disappoint him by cancelling the wedding. So, although she agreed to marry Sangkuriang, she would do so only on the condition that he provides her with a lake and built a beautiful boat, all in one night.<br /><br />Sangkuriang accepted this condition without a doubt. He had spent his youth studying magical arts. After the sun went down, Sangkuriang went to the hill. Then he called a group of genie to build a dam around Citarum River. Then, he commands the genies to cut down trees and build a boat. A few moments before dawn, Sangkuriang and his genie servants almost finished the boat.<br /><br />Dayang Sumbi, who had been spying on him, realised that Sangkuriang would fulfill the condition she had set. Dayang Sumbi immediately woke all the women in the village and asked them to wave a long red scarf. All the women in the village were waving red scarf, making it look as if dawn was breaking. Deceived by false dawn, the cock crowed and farmers rose for the new day.<br /><br />Sangkuriang’s genie servants immediately dropped their work and ran for cover from the sun, which they feared. Sangkuriang grew furious. With all his anger, he kicked the unfinished boat. The boat flew and landed on a valley. The boat then became a mountain, called Mount Tangkuban Perahu (Tangkuban means upturned or upside down, and Perahu means boat). With his power, he destroyed the dam. The water drained from the lake becoming a wide plain and nowadays became a city called Bandung (from the word Bendung, which means Dam).<br /><br />#dah gitu aja<br />#semoga bermanfaat<br />

<p>
</p>Drink the water immediately to quench your thirst. Without realizing it, that air is King Sungging Perbangkara's senior air. Because of the power of Raja Sungging Perbangkara, the boar was pregnant after drinking its urine. Nine months later the boar starts a baby girl.
<p>
</p>king of Sungging Perbangkara knows about the existence of a baby girl born because of the artistic air. He also went to the forest to look for it. The baby girl is expected. He also said Dayang Sumbi and returned to the royal palace.
<p>
</p>Court Lady Sunbi grew up to be a very beautiful woman. It felt like the countless kings, princes and nobles who wanted to marry the daughter of King Sungging Perbangkara. However, all the proposals were rejected by Dayang Sumbi smoothly. Not at all rejected by Dayang Sumbi, those who were rejected by the proposal fought each other to fight over themselves.
<p>
</p>Dayang Sumbi was very sad to understand the reality of the princes, kings and nobles whom he refused to fight each other. He also begged King Sungging Perbangkara to exile himself. The King finally allows you to isolate yourself. Dayang Sumbi secluded herself on a hill accompanied by a male dog named the tumang. To fill his spare time while in exile, Dayang Sumbi also weaved.
<p>
</p>Once upon a time, the compilation of Dayang Sumbi was weaving, weaving equipment fell. At that time Dayang Sumbi took it lazy to take it. Throwing words that he did not need to realize. "Whoever receives the fallen weaving equipment, if I were a man I would make a husband, if he were a woman he would be my brother."
<p>
</p>None of them took the fallen weaving equipment and gave it to Dayang Sumbi.
<p>
</p>There was nothing that Dayang Sumbi could do other than fulfill her words. He was married to Si Tumang who turned out to be incarnation of a god. The Tumang is a god who is cursed into an animal and thrown to earth. A few months after marriage, Dayang Sumbi was pregnant and gave birth to a baby boy. Dayang Sumbi received the name Sangkuriang.
<p>
</p>Time passed. A few years later passed. Sangkuriang has grown into an inviting handsome young man. Dashing. His body is strong and stocky. Sakti Mandraguna is also Dayang Sumbi's child.
<p>
</p>Since childhood, Sangkuriang has loved hunting. Every time hunting in the forest. Sangkuriang is always accompanied by the tumang. Sangkuriang did not know that Tumang was his biological father.
<p>
</p>One day Sangkuriang with his friend Si Tumang returned to hunt in the forest. Sangkuriang intends to look for deer because he really wants deer love. After a while in the forest, Sangkuriang saw a deer grazing behind a thicket. Sangkuriang invited the tumang to chase the deer Very strange, the Tumang who is usually obedient, the compilation did not obey his orders. Sangkuriang became angry. He said. "If asked to remain not according to my instructions, surely I will kill you."
<p>
</p>The threat of Sangkuriang seems to be ignored by Tumang. Because annoyed and angry, then Sangkuriang killed the Tumang. He took the black dog's heart and brought it home. Sangkuriang gives the Tumang's heart to be submitted for cooking.
<p>
</p>Unknowingly Dayang Sumbi, who was given the heart, was given. He then cooks and processes it. So, Dayang Sumbi's anger at Sangkuriang cannot be compiled, she knows that the heart she eats is the heart of the Tumang. He then grabbed a dipper made from a coconut shell and hit Sangkuriang's head, until Sangkuriang's head was injured.
<p>
</p>Sangkuriang was very angry and hurt by the guidance. According to him, his mother loved the Tumang more than he. So, without saying goodbye to Dayang Sumbi, Sangkuriang then wandered eastward.
<p>
</p>Dayang Sumbi was very sorry after learning about the departure of Sangkuriang the goat. He also imprisoned and begged forgiveness to the gods for the mistakes he made. The gods heard the request of Dayang Sumbi, they accepted the apology and gave Dayang Sumbi eternal beauty.
<p>
</p>Syahdan, Sangkuriang continues to wander without a definite purpose. In his wanderings, Sangkuriang continued to increase his magic by studying for magic people he met during his wandering. For years Sangkuriang wandered without realizing he returned to the place whereAll Done!!Nice To meet You<p></p><br />
